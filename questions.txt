Package 
    1. Define two different classes namely, Student (store in package stu) and 
    Employee. These classes are derived from a base class Person (store in 
    package per1). 
    Define other two classes Staff and Faculty. Staff and Faculty classes are 
    derived from Employee class. Employee, Staff and Faculty are stored in 
    the package emp. 
    The Person class has name and age data and display method to display the 
    name and age of a person. 
    The Student class has data like rollNo and branch and display method to 
    display name, age, rollNo and branch of the student. 
    Faculty has designation data (Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and 
    Professor) and display method to display the name, age, EmpId, doj and 
    designation of the Faculty. 
    Staff has EmpId and doj(date of joining) data, designation data (Technical 
    and Clerical) and display method to display the name, age, EmpId, doj and 
    designation of the Staff. 
    Each class has their own constructor to initialize the value of each data field. 
    Finally create MainDemoClass and create an object of each class. Print the 
    values of all objects in the MainDemoClass. Store MainDemoClass in 
    package mainpkg1. Create a package collegeMgt and store all the other 
    packages under collegeMgt. 

 2. Create a package named shapes. Create classes Square, Triangle, Circle 
    under the package shapes. The classes should contain mutator, accessor, 
    calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter() methods. Create Main Class, store 
    it in mainpkg2 package and create an object of each class in main(). Store 
    all the packages under package geometry.

3. Design a class named Person (store in package per2)with fields for holding a 
    person’s name, address and telephone number. Write one or more 
    constructors and the appropriate mutator and accessor methods for the class’ 
    fields. 
    Design another class named Customer (store in package cust), which inherits 
    from the Person class. 
    The Customer class should have a field for a customer number and a boolean 
    field indicating whether the customer wishes to be on a mailing list. Write 
    one or more constructors and the appropriate mutator and accessor methods 
    for the class’s fields. Demonstrate an object of the Customer class in Main 
    class (stores in the package mainpkg3). Store all the packages under 
    package custDemo.
